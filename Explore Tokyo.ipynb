    "Tokyo, the capital of japan, is one of the most desirable places people would love to visit. A trip without visiting this legendary capital city is incomplete. The cherry blossom festival and the fall foliage attract people around all around the world. \n",

    "Besides gazing out from Tokyo skytree, and wrestling with sumo culture in Ry≈çgoku, Tokyo is also a  \"battleground\" for good food.  Ramen is a must-have in Tokyo, though you may have tried tons of ramen, Tokyo represents the cutting edge of ramen. Edomae-zushi with your personalized toppings, monjayaki - both delicious and healthy, and unaju - fresh eel served over juicy rice.\n",
